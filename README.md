Pipeline for annotating genomes using long read transcriptomics data with stringtie and other tools
===================================================================================================

This `snakemake` pipeline creates GFF annotation from Oxford Nanopore cDNA or direct RNA reads.
The cDNA reads are optionally processed by [pychopper](https://github.com/nanoporetech/pychopper) for trimming and orientation. The prcoessed reads are mapped to the reference genome using [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2), and then processed by [stringtie](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie) in long read mode (with or withouth using a guide annotation) to generate the GFF annotation.

If an existing annotation is available, the inferred annotation is compared to it using [gffcompare](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/gffcompare.shtml) and a report is genereated.

Getting Started
===============

## Input

- The input reads must be in fastq format. 
- The input genome must be in fasta format.
- The existing annotations must be in GFF3 or GFF2 format.

## Output

The main output files generated by the pipeline are the following:

- `results/annotation/str_merged.gff` - annotation in [GFF2](http://gmod.org/wiki/GFF2) format
- `results/gffcompare/*` - comparison to the existing annotation (if provided) by the gffcompare tool ([documentation](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/gffcompare.shtml))
- `results/gffcompare/str_gffcmp_report.pdf` - visualization of `gffcompare` results

## Depedencies

- [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
- [snakemake](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - easily installed via conda
- The rest of the dependencies are installed via conda.

## Installation

Clone the pipeline and the pinfish toolset by issuing:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nanoporetech/pipeline-nanopore-ref-isoforms.git
```

## Usage

Edit `config.yml` to set the input genome, input fastq and parameters, then issue:

```bash
snakemake --use-conda -j <num_cores> all
```

### Research Release

Research releases are provided as technology demonstrators to provide early access to features or stimulate Community development of tools. Support for this software will be minimal and is only provided directly by the developers. Feature requests, improvements, and discussions are welcome and can be implemented by forking and pull requests. However much as we would like to rectify every issue and piece of feedback users may have, the developers may have limited resource for support of this software. Research releases may be unstable and subject to rapid iteration by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.
